## The Art of Team Leadership: Beyond the Scrum Master

In my IT career, I've held various roles: front-end developer, back-end engineer, scrum master. However, there's one role that truly captivated me and showed me the most fascinating side of management: that of the team leader.

### Team Leader vs Scrum Master: A Crucial Distinction

Many might think that team leader and scrum master are practically identical roles. However, from my experience, substantial differences emerge:

#### Scrum Master

- **Role in Agile/Scrum Framework:** A specific figure in the Scrum framework, guarantor of Agile principles and practices.
- **Facilitator:** Manages Scrum ceremonies and removes obstacles to team progress.
- **Coach and Mentor:** Promotes Agile values and supports the team's professional growth.
- **Team Protection:** Shields the team from external interference.
- **Not a Boss:** Operates through servant leadership, without hierarchical authority.

#### Team Leader

- **Flexible Role**: Adapts to various project management models.
- **Team Management**: Responsible for task assignment and team performance.
- **Project Responsibility**: Has an overview and interacts with stakeholders.
- **Hierarchical Authority**: May have decision-making power over team performance and composition.
- **Results-Oriented**: Focused on achieving project objectives.

So? Which figure is better? It depends! No, I'm kidding. I have a better answer: both and neither! I don't believe there's a perfect management technique or role classification, but I believe in the values and key points of multiple methodologies, and I believe that the best management is tailored to the team. So I ask myself and have asked: why not mix the values and objectives of these two figures?


### The Perfect Combination: My Vision of the Modern Team Leader

In my experience as a team leader, I've tried to combine the best of both worlds. Here's how I see the role of the modern team leader:

- **Facilitator and Unlocker**
The team leader has the primary duty of facilitating the work of their team. It's crucial to resist the temptation of "I'll do it in five minutes." Unblocking a team resource not only exercises coaching skills but allows the team leader to focus on strategic objectives.

- **Coach and Mentor**
An effective team leader doesn't just direct but shapes and molds their team. The goal is to create a cohesive unit in terms of processes, ceremonies, and common language. This approach fosters mutual trust and long-term efficiency.

- **Strategic Manager**
The team leader must always have a pulse on the situation: where the team is in the project, if it's behind or ahead, when to dedicate resources to reducing technical debt or technical improvement. However, task assignment should be a collaborative process, allowing the team to best leverage their skills and grow professionally.

- **Balanced Authority**
The team leader's hierarchical authority is a powerful tool, to be used wisely. It's crucial in the selection process and conflict resolution, but must be exercised with caution to avoid undermining team morale.

- **Motivator and Team Spirit Builder**
Keeping team morale high is fundamental, especially during challenging sprints or team formation phases. Organizing team building moments, even virtual ones, can make a difference in creating cohesion and alleviating stress.

- **Backlog Guardian and Planner**
The team leader must actively monitor the backlog (in the absence of a Product Owner) and effectively prepare future sprints. This overview is crucial for project success.

- **Feedback Master**
Knowing how to provide constructive feedback at the right time and in the appropriate way is an art that the team leader must master. This aspect is fundamental for individual and collective growth of the team.

## Flexibility and Adaptation

My leadership philosophy is a mix of agile methodologies and traditional approaches, always guided by common sense. Each team is unique, with its own dynamics and challenges. An effective team leader must know how to adapt their style and practices to the specific needs of the team and the project.

The true essence of team leadership lies in continuous improvement. A good team leader not only guides their team towards excellence but is also open to receiving feedback and constantly evolving.

What do you think? What's your experience with team leadership? What aspects do you consider crucial for a successful team leader in the current IT landscape? And above all, could it make sense to give a name to this new figure? I'm looking forward to numerous comments and opinions!

Enjoy!
