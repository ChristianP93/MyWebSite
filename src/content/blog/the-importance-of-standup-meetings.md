# The Importance of Standup Meetings

In any type of organization, regardless of size or project type, a team's ability to communicate effectively and remain aligned is crucial for success. I have had the opportunity to see how standup meetings, when executed correctly, can transform a group's productivity and cohesion. This article explores why these brief daily meetings are crucial and how they can be optimized to maximize their value.

### Why Standup Meetings are Important

  1. **Efficient Communication:** Standup meetings allow the team to quickly share key information and coordinate. They are not a checkpoint, but a valuable opportunity to align, share ideas, and express doubts. This direct and frequent communication is crucial for keeping the team moving forward.
  2. **Transparency and Trust:** By offering visibility into what each team member is doing, these meetings facilitate the alignment of objectives. When well-managed, they drastically increase trust within the team. Transparency is not just about sharing activities, but also challenges and successes, creating an environment of openness and mutual support.
  3. **Rapid Problem Resolution:** Problems must be identified as quickly as possible to allow management or those in charge of strategy to rectify work planning. During the standup, each team member has the opportunity, and the duty, to ask for support to unblock any issues. This could translate into an opportunity for pair programming, strengthening the team's skills and accelerating problem-solving.
  4. **Focus and Objectives:** Keeping the team focused on daily objectives is crucial. Standups promote a sense of personal and collective responsibility. It's vital to remind the entire team of the day's goals and those of the sprint. This moment also serves to reiterate why what's being done is important and what criteria determine the success of a sprint.
  5. **Progress Awareness:** Standups offer a daily view of the team's overall progress, facilitating the monitoring of activities and timelines. They are an important opportunity to have a global view of the project's progress, delving into details when necessary. This allows for anticipating potential delays or problems and celebrating successes in real-time.

### Rethinking the Approach to Standups

In many standup meetings, including some I've personally conducted, I've heard people start with the classic: "Yesterday I closed this task and today I'm working on that one." But does this approach really make sense, considering we already have tools like Jira, Asana, or GitHub to track activities?
I propose a change in perspective. Instead of focusing only on completed or planned activities, why not start the standup by answering the question: "What updates do you have since yesterday?"
This approach encourages a richer and more meaningful discussion. It could include:

- Unforeseen obstacles,
- New ideas or insights,
- Requests for collaboration or support,
- Celebrations of small successes,
- Reflection and sharing of failures,

### Managing Failures: A Case Study

Recently, I participated in a standup meeting of a team working on a highly important project. It was the team leader's turn, dealing with a complex core functionality of very high value for our client. His update was surprisingly honest: "I'm still on yesterday's task. I tried an approach all day, but in the end, I realized I had gone down a rabbit hole. I have to redo everything."
As the technical area manager, my reaction was supportive and understanding: "It's happened to all of us many times. Do you have clearer ideas now? If so, no problem, let's move forward."
This episode perfectly illustrates the value of an open and transparent approach in standup meetings. In this context, having spent a day on a truly complex task and having to start over has two huge and objective advantages:

- The knowledge of the context and the technology to be used has increased.
- The probability that the output of that task will be of higher quality compared to not starting over increases  considerably.

This experience underscores the importance of creating an environment where team members feel safe sharing not only successes but also challenges and failures. It's through these honest sharing that the team can truly learn, adapt, and improve.

### Conclusion

Standup meetings, when executed with the right mindset, are much more than simple status updates. As leaders, our job is to ensure that these meetings remain relevant, engaging, and action-oriented, creating an environment where both successes and failures can be discussed openly and constructively.
Let's remember that a team's true strength lies not only in its ability to execute tasks but in its ability to communicate effectively, adapt quickly, and support each other in the face of challenges. Standup meetings, when used to their best potential, are the perfect tool to cultivate these qualities.
I invite every leader and team member to rethink how they approach these daily meetings. With a small change in perspective and the creation of an environment of trust and openness, we can transform a simple ritual into a powerful catalyst for innovation, collaboration, and team success. Remember, sometimes it's through sharing what didn't work that we find the path to what will work better in the future.
