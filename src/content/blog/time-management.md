## Time Management - Flexibility and Adaptability

Have you ever thought that maybe you don’t need to read yet another article on time management? Well, this isn’t your typical article. Let’s set aside conventional techniques for a moment and focus on a fundamental question: what’s your real problem with time management?

### Identifying the Problem

Many of us find ourselves in similar situations:

1. The to-do list grows incessantly
2. Despite long work hours, it never seems to be enough

If you recognize yourself in these situations, you’re in good company. But instead of blindly applying the usual techniques, let’s try a different approach.

## Rethinking the Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro Technique, with its intervals of intense work and short breaks, is a great starting point. But what if we extended it to a larger scale, adapting it to the entire workday?

## A New Structure for Your Day

Imagine dividing your day into 4 main slots:

1. Team
2. Work
3. Communication
4. Organization

The beauty of this system lies in its flexibility: the duration of each slot can vary based on daily needs.

## Organization

Yes, we start with the last item on the list.

Many of us begin the day trying to organize activities, only to see plans vanish at the first unexpected event. Here’s an alternative approach:

Dedicate time at the end of the day to plan for the next day. It’s not a 10-minute activity: carve out the necessary time to do it well. In the morning, a quick check will suffice, freeing up valuable time to tackle more demanding tasks.

## Team

As a team leader, your priority is maintaining the team’s workflow. Here’s how to structure this crucial slot:

1. Review your to-do list
2. Examine team activities
3. Conduct the stand-up
4. Address any blockers or provide support

**Practical example:** Imagine discovering during the stand-up that a team member is blocked on a critical bug. Instead of letting the situation deteriorate to avoid shifting your day’s planning, you already have a dedicated time slot to help them immediately, avoiding project delays. If, instead, everything is running smoothly, dedicate the extra time to operational work.

## Work

This is the slot for actual work. These are the moments when you have the opportunity to stay focused.

## Communication

Set up 2 or 3 support slots during the day. For example:

- 9:30–10:30
- 14:00–14:30

If necessary, these slots could be used for pair programming sessions or code reviews.

## Intelligent Meeting Management

Reserve a specific slot for meetings, but remember: not every day requires meetings. Use this time strategically.

Example: In a typical week, you might have project meetings on Monday and Thursday, leaving other days free to further extend the work slot or the communication slot with team members.

## Let’s Get Practical

Let’s simulate a typical day:

- Slot 09:00–09:15: Quick check of the day’s todos
- Slot 09:15–10:30: Communication and possible team support
- Slot 10:30–13:00: Focus, operational work
- Slot 14:00–14:30: Possible support (optional)
- Slot 14:30–16:30: Focus, operational work
- Slot 16:30–17:30: Time for communications
- Slot 17:30–18:00: Organize tomorrow’s day

## The Golden Rule: Flexibility

The success of this approach is based on two pillars:

1. Organization: Structure your day proactively.
2. Discipline: Respect the slots, but be ready to adapt when necessary.

By adopting this flexible method, you’ll not only improve your time management but also create a more responsive and productive work environment. Remember, the goal is not to box yourself into a rigid routine, but to create a structure that adapts to your evolving needs.

Try this approach for a few weeks, adjusting as you go. You might discover a new level of productivity and satisfaction in your work.
