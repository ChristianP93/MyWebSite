During my experience at Ad2014 with the LetLife project, I began my professional career as a JavaScript developer, marking a turning point in my professional journey. This experience allowed me to grow rapidly, moving from front-end development to a full-stack developer role and finally to that of Scrum Master.

#### Growth

1. Front-end Developer:
   - Initial focus on front-end development using AngularJS
   - Implementation of UI/UX guidelines defined by the creative team

2. Full-stack Developer:
   - Expansion of skills towards back-end development
   - First steps in implementing Continuous Integration using Codeship

3. Scrum Master:
   - First experience in this leadership role
   - Introduction and implementation of Agile concepts such as sprints and sprint planning

#### Main responsibilities and achievements

- Development and maintenance of front-end and back-end functionalities of the LetLife project
- Identification and resolution of bottlenecks in the development process
- Implementation of Agile methodologies to improve team efficiency
- Management and coordination of sprint activities, facilitating team communication and collaboration

#### Impact and personal growth

- Significant acceleration of the development process after implementing Agile methodologies
- Reduction of confusion in task management and improvement of project goal clarity
- Discovery of a passion for management, opening new perspectives for professional development

#### Technologies and methodologies used

- AngularJS for front-end development
- NodeJS for Back-end technologies

- Agile methodologies (Scrum)

This experience, although not characterized by particular technical complexities given my level of experience at the time, proved to be fundamental for my professional development. The main added value was the opportunity to take on the role of Scrum Master, which allowed me to discover a new passion for management and acquire valuable skills in team and project management.
