During my experience at Enhancers, I had the opportunity to lead several teams in supporting and developing various crucial projects for ALG's (Alleanza Luce e Gas di Coop) digital transformation. The main objective was to create the new reserved area for electricity and gas customers and integrate it with the new systems implemented during this transformation process.

#### Main project components

1. Mobile application for ALG customers' Reserved Area
2. Web Application for ALG customers' Reserved Area
3. Back Office application for the reserved area

In addition to the typical core features of such a platform, the project required the creation of simple and resilient flows for migrating users from the old platform to the new one.

#### Technical challenges and solutions

- Complex integration with external providers such as Salesforce, Mulesoft, and Net@
- Management of hot database alignment
- Use of AWS SQS and Lambda functions for various alignments, introducing serverless architecture
- Implementation of the reserved area backend on AWS Elastic Beanstalk

This experience allowed me to significantly deepen my skills in:

- Serverless architectures and their optimizations
- Docker and CI/CD processes to simplify release activities
- Management of large-scale and complex projects

#### Managerial responsibilities

- Participation in all SAL (Work Progress Status) meetings and alignment with the client
- Organization of alignments with other development teams to simplify integration activities
- Participation in all pre-go-live ceremonies, including drafting and compiling testbooks
- Management and coordination of post-release support

The project concluded with great success, demonstrating the effectiveness of the implemented strategies and the team's ability to manage a large-scale project.

This experience significantly expanded both my technical and managerial skills, offering me a comprehensive view of how to govern complex projects in the context of corporate digital transformation. I gained valuable knowledge on how to balance technical needs with business requirements, manage multiple stakeholders, and guide teams towards ambitious goals in a rapidly evolving environment.
