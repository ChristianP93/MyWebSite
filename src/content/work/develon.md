During my experience at Develon, I played a key role in the development of Pharmaround, an innovative web and mobile application in the pharmaceutical sector. The project's goal was to provide users with comprehensive information about nearby pharmacies, including services, products for sale, opening hours, and on-duty pharmacies.

#### Main responsibilities

- Managing backlog and planning activities for frontend, backend, and mobile
- Conducting code reviews
- Creating technical documentation
- Monitoring velocity and producing reports
- Backend development
- Creating personas and product documentation

#### Main features

1. A booking system for in-store visits
2. A rotating advertising banner system divided by regions

This experience allowed me to actively participate in intense brainstorming sessions for new feature ideation. I also contributed to the creation of Personas and the project's SWOT analysis, thus enriching my skills not only in the technical field but also in product management and business strategy.

My role required a combination of technical and managerial skills, allowing me to oversee the entire product development cycle, from conception to realization. I had the opportunity to work on a project that has a direct impact on users' daily lives, improving accessibility to information about pharmacies and related services.

This experience strengthened my technical leadership skills, complex project management, and collaboration with multidisciplinary teams. It also broadened my understanding of challenges and opportunities in the healthcare and public service application sector.

There were also R&D activities to research Kubernetes, microservices, service mesh, and more!
